Monash University | Group 30\
📊 By Jyovika Aswale, Sia Chawla & Siddhi Jadhav

This project explores pedestrian traffic patterns across Flinders Street, Southern Cross, and QV Melbourne using R and Quarto. We built visualisations, fitted probability models (Normal, Lognormal, Gamma), estimated key percentiles, and calculated expected billboard revenue under a marketing offer scenario.

The report combines data cleaning, EDA, bootstrapping, and t-tests, presented through a fully formatted Quarto document (reportfinal.qmd). The final outputs are an interactive HTML report and a PDF version for submission.
